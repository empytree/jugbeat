Well, there is no license. The project jugbeat will be licensed later. However, I found this file useful for some disambiguation and contact information.

jugbeat as a ditributed project is a set of files named by a simple scheme:

- LICENSE.md (this file)
- README.md (brief description)
- jugbeat solo [version].amxd (pure solo implementation)

...

- jugbeat ([controller]) master [version].amxd (controller-specific master device)
- jugbeat ([controller]) track [version].amxd (controller-specific solo device)

...

- /patches/jugbeat solo [version].maxpat (exported patch for the title device, and so on)

...

Exported patches are stored for diff dynamics on GitHub.
